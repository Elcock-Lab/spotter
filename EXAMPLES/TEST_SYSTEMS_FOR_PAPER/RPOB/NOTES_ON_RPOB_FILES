Files in this folder are connected to Figures 4 and 6 though 8 of the text.

All input files use an RNAP rate file including the E. coli rpoB gene 
where transcription reaction rates have been determined under the assumption
that the mean lone-RNAP transcriptional elongation rate in the absence of 
supercoiling in 6.168 nt per second.

Because the simulations described in the paper were designed to explore
single-molecule experiments without translation, all input files in this
folder are set to the translation off option.

All input files also include RNAP rotational relaxation rates determined
by RNA length as described in the paper and the full complement of off
pathway backtracking reactions described there.

One input file corresponds to simulations representing a linearized 
plasmid transcriptional template (Figures 4 and 6 in the text):

	rpoB.lone_RNAP.linearized_plasmid.consolidated.inp

Simulations run with this input file will feature single RNAP runs on a 
template with freely-rotating DNA ends

Two input files correspond to simulations in which transcription occurs
within an insulated topological domain (Figures 7 and 8 of the text):

	rpoB.lone_RNAP.topo_domain.consolidated.inp

and

	rpoB.mulitple_RNAP.topo_domain.P23_release.consolidated.inp

The first of the files is designed for single-run RNAP simulations, while
the second, which includes an assistive-torque-mediated release from pause
states P2 and P3, is designed for simulations with mulitple RNAPs
transcribing simultaneously.
