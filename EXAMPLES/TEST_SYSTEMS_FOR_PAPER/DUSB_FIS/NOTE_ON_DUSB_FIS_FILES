The RNAP rate file included has been generated with the NET-seq-derived
energy function and has been set so that dwell times reproduce a mean
elongation rate of 30 nt/s for lone RNAPs in the absence of supercoiling

Dwell times used to make the ribosome rate file were taken from Li et al.
ribosome profiling data for cells in rich defined medium

The included input file sets up simulations in which the dusB/fis operon
is enclosed within a topological domain subject to topoisomerase I and
gyrase DNA relaxation reactions. RNAPs undergo rotaional relaxation as a
function of nascent RNA length as described in the main text and are
released from backtracked pauses at the original pause site when
experiencing 5 pN nm or more of assistive torque. The RNAP initiation rate
is set to 0.2 per second when the promoter is in the "on" state, with
promoter availability determined by "k_on" and "k_off" rates set in the
REGULATION section of the input file.
