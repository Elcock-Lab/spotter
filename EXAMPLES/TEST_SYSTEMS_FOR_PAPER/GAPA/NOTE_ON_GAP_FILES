Files included in this folder are related to Figures 10A and B.

The RNAP rate file included has been generated with the NET-seq-derived
energy function and has been set so that dwell times reproduce a mean
elongation rate of 30 nt/s for lone RNAPs in the absence of supercoiling.

Dwell times used to make the ribosome rate file were taken from Li et al.
ribosome profiling data for cells in rich defined medium

The included input file sets up simulations in which the gapA gene is
enclosed within a topological domain subject to topoisomerase I and gyrase
DNA relaxation reactions. RNAPs undergo rotaional relaxation as a function
of nascent RNA length as described in the main text, and are released from
backtracked pauses at their original pause sites when experiencing 5 pN nm
or more of assistive torque. The RNAP initiation rate is set to 0.1 per
second.
