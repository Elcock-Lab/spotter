	THIS FILE SETS UP A SIMULATION IN WHICH RNAPs EXPERIENCE ELEMENTAL PAUSES (BUT NOT
	ADVANCED PAUSES OR BACKTRACKING); ALL OTHER PARAMETERS ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE OF THE
	"BASIC" MODEL.

	***	DENOTES ENTRY DIFFERENT FROM SINGLE-STEP MODEL (tx.BASIC_TEMPLATE.inp)


----------------------------
BINDING AND ACTIVATION RATES
----------------------------

k_binding(RNAP)                          0.45			<-- Rate at which RNAPs associate with the
								    promoter ( /sec ).

k_unbinding(RNAP)                        0.00			<-- Rate at which an RNAP bound to the promoter
								    in the closed conformation dissociates from
								    the promoer ( /sec ).

k_closed_to_open(RNAP)                   10000.0		<-- Rate at which a promoter-bound RNAP in the closed
								    state converts to the open conformation. Note
								    that this reaction competes with the reaction
								    above (k_unbinding) when the latter is > 0.
								    In a simpler scheme, k_unbinding can be set to
								    zero, k_closed_to_open to a high rate ( >=
								    10000 / sec), and then the initiation rate will
								    essentially match the promoter-binding rate.

max_RNAP_loading_gap                     1000000		<-- If using a scheme where k_unbinding > 0, sets a
								    number of failure attempts after which the next
								    bound RNAP automatically achieves the closed->
								    open transition. Defaults to INFINITY (i.e, not
								    used) if line is not included. 

---------------------------------
POSITION-DEPENDENT REACTION RATES
---------------------------------

rnap_dwell_file                          rnap_rates.alaS	<-- File that lists position-specific transcriptional
								    reaction rates. This file is ***REQUIRED*** and
								    should be matched to the rates used below as
								    position-independent rates (this is ESSENTIAL
								    because the rates calculated by the RNAP rate 
								    generator depend on these values).

-----------------------------------
POSITION-INDEPENDENT REACTION RATES				<-- The rates listed in this section MUST match the
-----------------------------------				    model (that is the position-independent rates)
								    used in the RNAP rate-file generator (see
								    README_FOR_MAKING_INPUT_RNAP_REACTION_RATE_FILES).
								    NOTE: unless the " -param " flag is set in using
								    the generator to make the rate-file, parameters
								    default to a model WITH elemental but WITHOUT
								    advanced pauses, which are those listed below.

kp2                                      0.0			<-- Sets the rate at which RNAPs in the elementally-
								    paused state move to the advanced pause state P2.

kp3                                      0.0			<-- Sets the rate at which RNAPs in the P2 pause
								    state move to the most-advanced pause state P3.

ke1                                      1.77			<-- Sets the rate at which RNAPs in the elementally-
								    paused state escape to the pre-translocated 
								    state at the position they currently occupy.

ke2                                      0.241			<-- Sets the rate at which RNAPs in the advanced
								    pause state P2 escape, returning to the pre-
								    translocated state at the position they currently
								    occupy. Irrelevant if kp2 is set to zero.

ke3                                      0.01			<-- Parameter identical to ke2, but for the P3 pause
								    state.

kc                                       500			<-- Rate at which a nucleotide (irrespective of
								    identity) is added to the the nascent RNA chain
								    of an RNAP in the post-translocated state.

--------------
RNAP FOOTPRINT
--------------

RNAP_width(bp)                           35			<-- Sets the footprint of an RNAP.


------------------------
CONTACT-MEDIATED EFFECTS
------------------------

min_effector                             2			<-- Sets the "minimum" state required of an upstream
								    RNAP to exert a contact-mediated effect in which
								    a downstream RNAP is released from the pause
								    state when at a minimum distances from the 
								    upstream RNAP. If set to "1", RNAPs in the pre-
								    translocated or post-translocated state can
								    release a downstream RNAP; if set to "2", RNAPs
								    listed in option 1 plus elementally-paused RNAPs
								    can exert the effect; "3" is equivalent to "2"
								    plus RNAPs in P2; and "4" is equivalent to "3"
								    plus RNAPs in P3.

rnap_antipause                           0			<-- Switches inter-RNAP-contact-mediated pause escape
								    on (1) or off (0). Defaults to off.

ribo_antipause                           0			<-- Switches ribosome-RNAP-contact-mediated pause
								    escape on (1) or off (0). Defaults to off.

ribo_rnap_range                          2			<-- Separation in base-pairs between first-loaded
								    ribosome and an RNAP required for the ribosome
								    to exert its anti-pause effect.

p_rnap_rnap_push                         -0.01			<-- This and the following parameter are used to test
								    a crude model of inter-RNAP communication in which
								    upstream RNAPs or ribosomes "push" downstream
								    RNAPs obstructing their progress with the listed
								    probabilities. These pushes are applied to stacked
								    RNAPs recursively. NOTE: Non-zero probabilities
								    can only be used with the **no_pause** model below
								    (a one-state, consolidated model of transcription)
								    and their effects have not been fully tested.
								    Set to negative values to switch pushing off; this
								    is the default
								    
p_ribosome_rnap_push                     -0.01			<-- Probability that a pioneer ribosome attempting to
								    move will push an obstructing RNAP (see above). As
								    with the RNAP-initiated push, a successful push
								    will be followed by a push on the next RNAP in a 
								    traffic jam. REQUIRES "no-pause" model; not fully
								    tested. Set to negative value to turn off
								    (default).

-----------------------
BACKTRACKING PARAMETERS
-----------------------

backtracking_model(y/n)                  n			<-- Switches RNAP backtracking on or off. NOTE:
								    BACKTRACKING ASSUMES THAT RNAPS HAVE ACCESS TO
								    THE ADVANCED PAUSE STATES P1 OR P2. OPTION
								    SHOULD BE SET TO "n" FOR NO-PAUSE OR ELEMENTAL-
								    PAUSE-ONLY MODELS.

max_backtrack                            10			<-- Sets the maximum distance upstream of the initial
								    pause site a backtracked RNAP is allowed to reach

bt_adjustment                            10.0			<-- Factor by which off-pathway translocation
								    rates are reduced in order to reduce simulation
								    cost; defaults to 1.0.

-----------------------
ADDITONAL MODEL OPTIONS
-----------------------

no_pause_model(y/n)                      n			<-- If "y" is selected, use a one-step transcription		***
								    model. Uses the total dwell time at each position
								    rather than pause-entry and forward transloation
								    to determine occupancy time. NOTE: this option
								    can be used with files generated with any position-
								    independent parameter file; the simulator can
								    use the net dwell time provided while ignoring
								    rates of translocation, pausing, etc.

anticascade_model(y/n)                   n			<-- If set to "y", prevents forward translocation
								    attempts by an RNAP obstructed by a downstream
								    obstacle until there is sufficient space for
								    the forward step. Effect in actual simulations
								    seems to be minimal.

bubble_adjust(y/n)                       n			<-- If set to "y", removes the length of DNA included
								    in the transcription bubble from inter-RNAP
								    distances; under-/overwinding is distributed over
								    a smaller length of DNA for closely-spaced RNAPs.

upstream_bubble(nt)                      10			<-- Portion of the transcription bubble assigned to
								    the region upstream of the RNAP active site.

downstream_bubble(nt)                    2			<-- Portion of the transcription bubble assigned to
								    the region downstream of the RNAP active site.

DNA_scrunching(y/n)                      n			<-- If set to "y", accounts for the "scrunching" of
								    of DNA at initial positions while an RNAP is
								    still promoter-bound but has a "front edge"
								    advancing along the template. Should use RNAP
								    reaction rate file made with scrunching option.

RNA/DNA_hybrid_length(bp)                9			<-- Sets the length of the hybrid duplex; with the
								    scunching option on, an RNAP will dissociate from
								    the promoter and the initial extended bubble will
								    collapse when the nascent RNA reaches this length.

TSS_size_adj(bp)                         0			<-- Additional space required to load an RNAP beyond
								    the RNAP footprint listed above. Helps to reduce
								    traffic jams at very high RNAP initiation rates.

----------------------------
SURVEILLANCE AND TERMINATION
----------------------------

k_term_stalled_RNAP(/sec)                0.0			<-- Sets rate at which stalled RNAPs will be
								    terminate transcription and be removed from the
								    template. Terminated RNAPs add "mature" but
								    incomplete RNAs to the pool of extant RNAs.

mfd_surveillance_time(mean,s)            99999999		<-- This reaction and the reaction below are designed
								    to mimic the effects of mfd, which terminates
								    RNAPs making slow transcriptional progress. The
								    value here sets the mean time between "checkups"
								    in which RNAP transcriptional progress is assessed
								    by mfd.

mfd_evaluation_window(s)                 99999999		<-- Sets the time period over which RNAP progress is
								    evaluated. Once a "checkup" is started with the
								    mfd surveillance reaction above, RNAPs whose mean
								    rate of transcription is less than 7 nt/s in the
								    evaluation window are terminated.
