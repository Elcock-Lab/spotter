	THIS FILE SETS UP A SIMULATION IN WHICH TRANSCRIPTION OCCURS WITHIN A CLOSED TOPOLOGICAL
	DOMAIN: BARRIERS TO THE DIFFUSION OF SUPERCOILING ARE PRESENT UPSTREAM OF THE TSS AT THE
	POSITION INDICATED (loc_start_barrier) AND DOWNSTREAM OF THE LAST BP TRANSCRIBED IN THE
	OPERON (loc_stop_barrier). ALL OTHER PARAMETERS ARE IDENTICAL TO THOSE IN THE TEMPLATE
	SUPERCOILING INPUT FILE.

	***	DENOTES ENTRY DIFFERENT FROM TEMPLATE FILE (super.BASIC_TEMPLATE.inp)


------------------
GENERAL PARAMETERS
------------------

no_supercoiling_sim(y/n)                 n			<-- Switches "no supercoiling" setting on or off.
								    If "y", RNAPs in the simulation interact only
								    sterically--note that if a supercoiling file is
								    not supplied (or this line does not appear in a
								    file with "n" selected), it is assumed that the
								    simulation does NOT include supercoiling.

writhe_partition                         n			<-- If set to "y", distributes DNA under- or over-
								    winding into twist and writhe based on DNA
								    minicircle simulations; if set to "n", all
								    supercoiling density is assigned to twist.

starting_sigma                           -0.03			<-- Sets initial supercoiling density on the DNA 
								    template. If template is a linearized template,
								    starting sigma will be zero, overriding any value
								    assigned here.

tx_on_plasmid                            n			<-- If "n", transcription is assumed to be on a			***
								    chromosomal template with topological barriers
								    upstream of the TSS and downstream of the
								    transcriptional stop site. If "y", transcription
								    occurs on a linear template with freely-rotating
								    ends if "linearized template" is selected in the
								    next line or on a circular template if it is not
								    selected.

linearized_plasmid                       n			<-- See "tx_on_plasmid" above					***


-----------------------------------
SPECIFICATIONS FOR INSULATED DOMAIN
-----------------------------------

loc_start_barrier                        -4459			<-- If using a chromosomal template, this value sets		***
								    the position of the upstream topological barrier
								    relative to the TSS. If using a linerarized
								    plasmid template, this value sets the length of
								    the template upstream of TSS but does *NOT* set
								    the position of a topological barrier. If using 
								    an uncut plasmid, this value should be one-half
								    of the length of the DNA separating transcription
								    stop and start sites (e.g., -2500 if there are
								    5000 bp between the end of the transcription unit
								    and the TSS on the plasmid ring); as with the
								    linearized plasmid case, a topological barrier is
								    not set for the uncut plasmid template.

loc_stop_barrier                       	 4459			<-- Value gives the the number of bp downstream of		*** 
								    the end of the transcription unit. As above, if
								    the template is chromosomal, this is also the
								    location of a topological barrier. In the case of
								    a linearized plasmid, this value only defines the
								    total length of the DNA; and in the case of an
								    uncut plasmid, the value should be set to 1/2 of
								    the stop-to-start separation (2500 in the example
								    above)

---------------------------
TOPOISOMERASE IA PARAMETERS
---------------------------

rate_topoisomerase_I(/sec)               0.000			<-- Sets the rate (/sec) at which topoisomerase I
								    attempts to bind the DNA template; this is the
								    rate at which attempts will be made on the 
								    *entire* template length.

inter_rnap_binding(y/n)                  y			<-- Allow/do not allow binding of topoisomerase I
								    between transcribing RNAPs.

guided_topo_binding(y/n)                 y			<-- If set to "y", only allow topoisomerase I binding
								    upstream of the TSS.

relative_topo_IA_ds_binding              0.1			<-- If "guided_binding" is off, relative probability
								    of topoisomerase I binding downstream of preferred
								    locations upstream of the TSS.

lagtime_topo_IA(s)                       5.000			<-- Mean time after binding at which topoisomerase I
								    becomes competent to relax DNA.

p_rnap_topoIA_eject                      1.0			<-- Probability that when an RNAP encounters 
								    topoisomerase I on the template that the RNAP will
								    remove the enzyme rather than be obstructed.

topo_IA_width                            50			<-- "Footprint" of topoisomerase I in bp.

rel_extra_topo                           0.5			<-- Factor by which the probability of a successful
								    binding attempt in regions downstream of the most-
								    downstream RNAP is reduced.

-----------------
GYRASE PARAMETERS
-----------------

rate_gyrase(/sec)                        0.00			<-- Sets the rate (/sec) at which gyrase attempts to
								    bind the DNA templae; as with the topoisomerase I
								    rate, this a rate for the entire template region.

guided_gyrase_binding(y/n)               y			<-- If set to "y", gyrase is only allowed to bind
								    downstream of the last-transcribed position in the
								    template.

relative_gyrase_ds_affinity              1.0			<-- If guided gyrase binding is off, factor by which
								    the affinity of a gyrase bound to a site upstream
								    of the last transcribed site is reduced; the lower
								    affinity is expressed as increased k off.

p_rnap_gyrase_eject                      1.0			<-- Probability that a transcribing RNAP will displace
								    rather than be blocked by a bound gyrase.

max_gyrase_sigma                         -0.05			<-- Lowest sigma value to which gyrase activity is
								    allowed to reduce local supercoiling density

gyrase_width                             150			<-- "Footprint" of bound gyrase in bp.


---------------
RNAP PARAMETERS
---------------

max_torque_P2_P3_release                 -50.00			<-- Used to allow supercoiling-mediate effects on
								    advanced pause states. If the torque experienced
								    by an RNAP in state P2 or P3 at the site of its
								    initial pause is equal to or less than this value
								    (in pN.nm), the RNAP exits the pause

min_upstream_sigma_move                  -0.10			<-- Minimum sigma value permitted for an RNAP to
								    forward-translocate


RNAP_relax_factor                        -1.0			<-- Relative rate at which RNAPs rotate to reduce
								    disparities in upstream and downstream 
								    supercoiling.  NOTE: SHOULD BE SET TO A NEGATIVE
								    VALUE IN SIMULATIONS WITHOUT RNAP ROTATION.

ribosome_resistance_model                implicit_RNAP_position <-- Sets rotational resistance model in simulations in
								    which RNAPs undergo rotational relaxation. Options
								    are: "flat resistance", in which resitance to 
								    rotation is constant at all positions (set below);
								    "none_RNA_only", in which only the length of the
								    the attached nascent RNA is considered; 
								    "implicit_RNAP_position", in which the number of
								    ribosomes is estimated based on RNAP template
								    position and the ribosome density asssigned below;
								    "implicit_RNA_model", in which the number of
								    ribosomes is estimated using the current RNA
								    length (accounting for degradtion); and 
								    "explict_ribosomes", which explicitly includes the
								    effect of all ribosomes currently translating the
								    nascent RNA.	

implicit_interribo_dist(nt)              100.0			<-- Used to estimate the number of ribosomes
								    translating an RNA in the implict resistance
								    models above.

flat_resist_parameter                    0.04			<-- Sets a value for rotation resistance at all sites
								    when the "flat_resistance" model is used.

length_exponent                          1.5			<-- Sets the exponent on the the length-dependent
								    function used to determine RNA contribution to
								    rotational resistance. Defaults to 1.5 (3/2).

sigma_sensitive_init(y/n)                n                      <-- Determines whether or not the rate of the
                                                                    closed-to-open transition is affected by
                                                                    supercoiling density at the promoter.
                                                                    Defaults to "no".
